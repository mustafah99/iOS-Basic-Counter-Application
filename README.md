# iOS-Basic-Counter-Application
My first iOS Application where I've added functionality. It's a simple counter application with an increment function, a decrement function and a reset button which resets the counter to zero count.
Very easy to use. Design inspired by Counter+ on App Store.

The application is only a single page application where I use an if statement as well as I assign an integer to a variable where I display it on the application using string interpolation.
